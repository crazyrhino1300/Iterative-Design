                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    We were tasked with choosing a accelerator startup from S22, W22, or W23 
                    and designing an interface based purely off of the concept listed on the accelerator. 
                    In order to achieve this, we'd like to share our low-fidelity mockups and sketches that 
                    represent the imagined interface. Then, you will get to explore our high-fidelity mockups which
                    took our low-fidelity mockups and brought them to life through Figma. In the final components of 
                    our work, we garned results from UserTesting to understand how effective and easily usable our 
                    interface is. 
                </p>
                <h3>Our Startup Selection: Koala</h3>
                <p>
                    Koala is an all-in-one tool for online tutors! Its main goal is serve as an effective tool for tutors 
                    to engage with students who actively struggle with Zoom fatigue and online learning. In solving 
                    this problem, Koala equips tutors with educational games that engage students suffering from 
                    these conditions more effectively than traditional online teaching methods. In implementing this,
                    Koala itself serves as not only a teaching space, but also a marketplace for tutors, parents, and 
                    students alike.

                <h1><u>Low-Fidelity</u></h1>
                <p>
                    After consideration and deliberation, we were able to cohesively synthesize
                    our 12 sketches into a low-fidelity replica that would represent three interfaces
                    for the three types of users: students, tutors, and parents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We came to the conclusion that for each interface, there were some key components:
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <h2><i>Students</i></h2>
                <li>Dashboard: to view their upcoming sessions.</li>
                <li>Session: where they will be engaging with the tutor in the interactive educational game.</li>
                
                <p></p>
                <h2><i>Parents</i></h2>
                <li>Dashboard: to view their child's progress and to see their schedule.</li>
                <li>Searching for Tutors: to sign their child up for more or different tutors.</li>
                <li>Billing and Subscriptions: to view their subscription plan and pay any outstanding bills.</li>

                <p></p>
                <h2><i>Tutors</i></h2>
                <li>Dashboard: to view their schedule and launch any upcoming meetings.</li>
                <li>Session: where they will be engaging with the student in the interactive educational game.</li>
                <li>Schedule: garnering inspiration from Google Calendar, we wanted a layout that would mimic that mental
                    model of a calendar for their schedule.
                </li>

                                Through UserTesting, we were able to have outside users test out our interface and provide us with valuable feedback. 
                                In our UserTesting sessions, we asked these testers to pretend that they were Koala online tutors, tasked with running 
                                their business successfully utilizing this platform. And overall, we expected our testers to be able to navigate through 
                                the interface and encounter what we thought were crucial day-to-day tasks that needed to be completed in order for an online 
                                tutor to successfully run their business: log in, start a meeting, check schedule, and prepare for upcoming sessions. All three 
                                testers performed in line with our expectations and completed the overarching task under 9 minutes while providing verbal feedback 
                                for further improvement on our interface.

                                They also verbally communicated that they didn’t find the tasks difficult but were mainly confused about gaps in the interactive

                                amongst dates and information presented for all types of users. Furthermore, we may look into moving the “launch meeting” button under 
                                the student profile and having that be connected to the students’ information listed under “Upcoming Sessions.” This was suggested by 
                                one of the testers who was worried that she may be starting the wrong meeting. While our initial thoughts were that no tutor could have 
                                more than one session at a time, it may be in our best interest to clear up these connections with the “launch meeting” and put them 
                                in a place that is memorable and learnable to users.

            <h1><u>Concluding Thoughts</u></h1>
            <p>We hoped that you enjoyed this exploration of what goes into developing an
                interactive interface for online students, tutors, and parents. From this, we 
                strongly encourage and appreciated the feedback we received from both individuals who
                were aware of the work that we were doing but also from outsiders who had no idea that this 
                was a project. Moving forward, we would definitely continue to seek out as much feedback as time 
                enables and continue working on our mockups so that they are accessible, learnable, and easily usable for 
                any demographic. </p>
