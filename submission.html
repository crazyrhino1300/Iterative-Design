                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    We were tasked with choosing a accelerator startup from S22, W22, or W23 
                    and designing an interface based purely off of the concept listed on the accelerator. 
                    In order to achieve this, we'd like to share our low-fidelity mockups and sketches that 
                    represent the imagined interface. Then, you will get to explore our high-fidelity mockups which
                    took our low-fidelity mockups and brought them to life through Figma. In the final components of 
                    our work, we garned results from UserTesting to understand how effective and easily usable our 
                    interface is. 
                </p>
                <h3>Our Startup Selection: Koala</h3>
