                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    We were tasked with choosing a accelerator startup from S22, W22, or W23 
                    and designing an interface based purely off of the concept listed on the accelerator. 
                    In order to achieve this, we'd like to share our low-fidelity mockups and sketches that 
                    represent the imagined interface. Then, you will get to explore our high-fidelity mockups which
                    took our low-fidelity mockups and brought them to life through Figma. In the final components of 
                    our work, we garned results from UserTesting to understand how effective and easily usable our 
                    interface is. 
                </p>
                <h3>Our Startup Selection: Koala</h3>
                <p>
                    Koala is an all-in-one tool for online tutors! Its main goal is serve as an effective tool for tutors 
                    to engage with students who actively struggle with Zoom fatigue and online learning. In solving 
                    this problem, Koala equips tutors with educational games that engage students suffering from 
                    these conditions more effectively than traditional online teaching methods. In implementing this,
                    Koala itself serves as not only a teaching space, but also a marketplace for tutors, parents, and 
                    students alike.
