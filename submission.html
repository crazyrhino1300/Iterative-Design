                <h3>Project Overview</h3>
                <p>
                    We were tasked with choosing a accelerator startup from S22, W22, or W23 
                    and designing an interface based purely off of the concept listed on the accelerator. 
                    In order to achieve this, we'd like to share our low-fidelity mockups and sketches that 
                    represent the imagined interface. Then, you will get to explore our high-fidelity mockups which
                    took our low-fidelity mockups and brought them to life through Figma. In the final components of 
                    our work, we garned results from UserTesting to understand how effective and easily usable our 
                    interface is. 
                </p>
                <h3>Our Startup Selection: Koala</h3>
                <p>
                    Koala is an all-in-one tool for online tutors! Its main goal is serve as an effective tool for tutors 
                    to engage with students who actively struggle with Zoom fatigue and online learning. In solving 
                    this problem, Koala equips tutors with educational games that engage students suffering from 
                    these conditions more effectively than traditional online teaching methods. In implementing this,
                    Koala itself serves as not only a teaching space, but also a marketplace for tutors, parents, and 
                    students alike.

                <h1><u>Low-Fidelity</u></h1>
                <p>
                    After consideration and deliberation, we were able to cohesively synthesize
                    our 12 sketches into a low-fidelity replica that would represent three interfaces
                    for the three types of users: students, tutors, and parents.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We came to the conclusion that for each interface, there were some key components:
                </p>
                <p></p>
                <h2><i>Students</i></h2>
                <li>Dashboard: to view their upcoming sessions.</li>
                <li>Session: where they will be engaging with the tutor in the interactive educational game.</li>
                
                <p></p>
                <h2><i>Parents</i></h2>
                <li>Dashboard: to view their child's progress and to see their schedule.</li>
                <li>Searching for Tutors: to sign their child up for more or different tutors.</li>
                <li>Billing and Subscriptions: to view their subscription plan and pay any outstanding bills.</li>

                <p></p>
                <h2><i>Tutors</i></h2>
                <li>Dashboard: to view their schedule and launch any upcoming meetings.</li>
                <li>Session: where they will be engaging with the student in the interactive educational game.</li>
                <li>Schedule: garnering inspiration from Google Calendar, we wanted a layout that would mimic that mental
                    model of a calendar for their schedule.
                </li>

                <h1><u>High-Fidelity Mockups</u></h1>
                <p>Taking our low-fidelity mockups, we translated our ideas into a Figma prototype
                    interface and presented it to peers and industry members to gauge feedback. 
                    Here are the following feedback points we implemented into our improved prototype: 
                </p>

                <div>
                    <li>Improve consistency with a home button and make it so that the logo is the standard
                        method of directing from a page back to the dashboard amongst all users.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Reduce information on pages for clarity and readability.
                    </li>
                    <li>Provide orientation for the user and where they are within the interface by filling in 
                        the button corresponding to the page they are currently on.
                    </li>
                    <li>Include a search bar for the 'search tutor' page.</li>
                    <li>Reduce repetitive text.</li>

            <div class="user_testing">
                <h1><u>User Testing and Analysis</u></h1>
                <p>While feedback from peers and industry professionals were valuable, we were also able to take time to share
                    our prototype with individuals who had no outside information about this work and were able to provide another set
                    of perspective.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Through UserTesting, we were able to have outside users test out our interface and provide us with valuable feedback. 
                    In our UserTesting sessions, we asked these testers to pretend that they were Koala online tutors, tasked with running 
                    their business successfully utilizing this platform. And overall, we expected our testers to be able to navigate through 
                    the interface and encounter what we thought were crucial day-to-day tasks that needed to be completed in order for an online 
                    tutor to successfully run their business: log in, start a meeting, check schedule, and prepare for upcoming sessions. All three 
                    testers performed in line with our expectations and completed the overarching task under 9 minutes while providing verbal feedback 
                    for further improvement on our interface. 
                </p>

                <h3>Subtasks</h3>
                <div>
                    <li>Log in as a tutor and take in the dashboard while making comments on where they would click first.
                    </li>
                    <li>Make a note of the students listed under “Upcoming Sessions.”
                    </li>
                    <li>Launch a meeting and check that the student is in the meeting.
                    </li>
                    <li>Check schedule.
                    </li>
                    <li>Purchase a game in preparation for another upcoming session.
                    </li>
                    <li>Confirm that the game was added to the lesson plans for one of the students.
                    </li>
                </div>
                <p></p>
                <div>
                    <h3>Types of Errors</h3>
                    <p>An error that we noticed was that the testers were confused about dates when making note of the schedule and 
                    the students listed under “Upcoming Sessions.” This was in part because of inconsistency with the students 
                    listed under “Upcoming Sessions” and difference in dates since one of our testers was from the United Kingdom. 
                    We had listed the date as “11/10” which for UK testers, or European testers, indicates October 10th while we had 
                    meant it for November 10th. 
                    </p>

                    <p>Another error that the testers encountered was confirming the payment upon purchasing the game. Since we did not 
                    have another frame confirming a purchase was made, there was no interactive button to indicate that they completed the 
                    task to purchase a game.
                    </p>
                </div>

                <h3>General Performance on Tasks</h3>
                <p>Overall, the testers had little to no difficulty navigating the interface and landing on the pages we were directing them to. 
                    They also verbally communicated that they didn’t find the tasks difficult but were mainly confused about gaps in the interactive 
                    interface. 
                </p>

                <h3>Potential Interface Changes Based On Results</h3>
                <p>Based on the feedback and results we received, some potential interface changes that we would make would include ensuring consistency 
                    amongst dates and information presented for all types of users. Furthermore, we may look into moving the “launch meeting” button under 
                    the student profile and having that be connected to the students’ information listed under “Upcoming Sessions.” This was suggested by 
                    one of the testers who was worried that she may be starting the wrong meeting. While our initial thoughts were that no tutor could have 
                    more than one session at a time, it may be in our best interest to clear up these connections with the “launch meeting” and put them 
                    in a place that is memorable and learnable to users.

            <h1><u>Concluding Thoughts</u></h1>
            <p>We hoped that you enjoyed this exploration of what goes into developing an
                interactive interface for online students, tutors, and parents. From this, we 
                strongly encourage and appreciated the feedback we received from both individuals who
                were aware of the work that we were doing but also from outsiders who had no idea that this 
                was a project. Moving forward, we would definitely continue to seek out as much feedback as time 
                enables and continue working on our mockups so that they are accessible, learnable, and easily usable for 
                any demographic. </p>
